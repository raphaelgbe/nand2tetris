# Nand2Tetris: approaches on projects

These are my solutions for the Nand2Tetris homework available on Coursera([part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) and [part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2)): the first half of the courses (parts 1 to 6) focus on building the hardware for the Hack computer through HDL (Hardware Description Language), while the second one builds upon the Hack computer to build a barebone OS and programmation language from the ground up (from assembly language to VM language to Jack, a Java-like simplified language). The ninth project, which gives a bit more freedom, is about building a program for this computer in Jack: I have chosen to build a game of Breakout, but in retrospect many optimizations would be needed (typically using a coarser grid for movements or adding some randomization to the physics engine).
